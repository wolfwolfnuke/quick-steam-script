# fastest when reachable, but it is also the most commonly MITM'd and IP-
# blocked DoH endpoint (Turkey, Iran, etc. routinely intercept TLS to it),
# so Google and AdGuard follow immediately as alternates. DNS.SB is included
# because it is rarely on any block list. Quad9 (9.9.9.9) is intentionally
# omitted — it requires HTTP/2 (RFC 8484 §5.2), which Python's stdlib does
# not implement, so it always returns 505 over HTTP/1.1.
#
# The IPv6 endpoints come last: dual-stack and IPv4-only hosts try the
# faster IPv4 resolvers first, while on an IPv6-only network (NAT64/DNS64,
# DS-Lite) the IPv4 entries fail fast and the IPv6 ones take over.
